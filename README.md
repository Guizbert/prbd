# Projet prbd-2223-a16 - MyPoll

## Overview

**MyPoll** is a project developed using C# as part of a school assignment. It was our first solo project.

This is a Windows application that allows users to create their own polls and enables others to vote.
### Screenshots :
- **Main Screen**: Polls that you have already answered are highlighted in green, closed polls are in red-pink, and unanswered polls are in gray. You can view poll information, the top choice(s), and their ratings.

- **Poll Details**: Double-clicking on a poll opens a new tab displaying the poll title, possible answers, the choices made by others, and a comment section at the bottom. Clicking the 'Add comment' button reveals a text input and a submit button. Note: Only the creator of the poll can delete comments.

- **Voting**: You can vote, save, or cancel your choices. (FYI: An error may occur when voting, and I couldnâ€™t resolve it before the deadline.)

- **Creating/Editing a Poll**: You can set the title, choose the type (Multiple = multiple choice or single choice), and close the poll using a checkbox. You can manage participants by adding yourself or all users in the database. On the right side, you can add choices. The numbers in parentheses indicate how many votes each user has made, and the choices show how many times they have been selected.
